# Selenium Tests for Vaadin "Master-Detail" Template

## Mission

While performing Selenium tests on the Vaadin "Master-Detail" template, I realized that the CRUD fields of the application do not apply validations. This means that you can create entries with empty or erroneous data, which makes it impossible to properly develop failing tests.

To address this issue, I have modified the code to add validations.
